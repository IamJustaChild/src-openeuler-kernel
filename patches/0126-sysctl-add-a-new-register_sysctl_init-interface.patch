Subject: [PATCH 126/132] sysctl: add a new register_sysctl_init() interface

mainline inclusion
from mainline-v5.17-rc1
commit 3ddd9a808cee7284931312f2f3e854c9617f44b2
category: feature
bugzilla: https://gitee.com/openeuler/kernel/issues/I5W44S
Reference: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3ddd9a808cee7284931312f2f3e854c9617f44b2

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Patch series "sysctl: first set of kernel/sysctl cleanups", v2.

Finally had time to respin the series of the work we had started last
year on cleaning up the kernel/sysct.c kitchen sink.  People keeps
stuffing their sysctls in that file and this creates a maintenance
burden.  So this effort is aimed at placing sysctls where they actually
belong.

I'm going to split patches up into series as there is quite a bit of
work.

This first set adds register_sysctl_init() for uses of registerting a
sysctl on the init path, adds const where missing to a few places,
generalizes common values so to be more easy to share, and starts the
move of a few kernel/sysctl.c out where they belong.

The majority of rework on v2 in this first patch set is 0-day fixes.
Eric Biederman's feedback is later addressed in subsequent patch sets.

I'll only post the first two patch sets for now.  We can address the
rest once the first two patch sets get completely reviewed / Acked.

This patch (of 9):

The kernel/sysctl.c is a kitchen sink where everyone leaves their dirty
dishes, this makes it very difficult to maintain.

To help with this maintenance let's start by moving sysctls to places
where they actually belong.  The proc sysctl maintainers do not want to
know what sysctl knobs you wish to add for your own piece of code, we
just care about the core logic.

Today though folks heavily rely on tables on kernel/sysctl.c so they can
easily just extend this table with their needed sysctls.  In order to
help users move their sysctls out we need to provide a helper which can
be used during code initialization.

We special-case the initialization use of register_sysctl() since it
*is* safe to fail, given all that sysctls do is provide a dynamic
interface to query or modify at runtime an existing variable.  So the
use case of register_sysctl() on init should *not* stop if the sysctls
don't end up getting registered.  It would be counter productive to stop
boot if a simple sysctl registration failed.

Provide a helper for init then, and document the recommended init levels
to use for callers of this routine.  We will later use this in
subsequent patches to start slimming down kernel/sysctl.c tables and
moving sysctl registration to the code which actually needs these
sysctls.
